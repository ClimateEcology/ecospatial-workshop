# Introduction to the **beeshiny** data app

This repository holds the material needed to recreate the workshop introducing [**beeshiny**](https://beesuite.psu.edu/beeshiny/), which was held at the [EcoSpatial Summit](https://ecospatialsummit.com/) on Oct. 10-11, 2024. Beeshiny is a web-based tool that makes it easier to access the land use, habitat quality, weather and climate data currently featured in [Beescape](https://beescape.psu.edu/), another tool developed by Penn State University. Beescape can be used by beekeepers, gardeners, urban planners, growers, researchers, and land managers to assess the quality of their landscapes for supporting bees and other pollinators. Beeshiny is a researcher-focused complement to Beescape.

The workshop covered topics on how to use R to process GIS layers and tabular outputs downloaded from the beehiny app. The instructions for these tutorials are included as html files within the main repository directory.
